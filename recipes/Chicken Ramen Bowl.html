<h1>How To Make A Yummy Chicken Ramen Bowl</h1>
<p> Ramen bowls are all the rage, and I've been dying to try this at home, especially now that the holiday hoopla is over and I'm setting my sights on eating whole. I never skimp on flavor, even when I'm eating light. This dish is a total flavor bomb, filled with a rich broth, tender meat, and noodles, all topped with a seven-minute egg â€” my new favorite thing in the world. My family went nuts for this; it's complex, easy, and satisfying. You don't have to make the egg, but I think it's so worth it. </p>
